# PacMen

## Project description

This is a simple 2d animation. It allows users to add multiple PacMen to the screen. Once "Start Game"
is clicked, all PacMen start to move. They have different velocity, and different random route. Once
they get to the border of the screen they bounce. 

Any new PacMen can be added anytime. PacMen can be removed with Delete button.

## How to run 

Just download the project and start **index.html** file. Then add some PacMen with a button and click 
"Start Game" to initiate the animation.

## Roadmap of future improvements

It'd be great to pack each PacMan inside a corresponding JS class object. Also it would look nice
if we could decouple the pac mouth animation frequency from the movement. Making it asynchronous
and controlled by the class object.
